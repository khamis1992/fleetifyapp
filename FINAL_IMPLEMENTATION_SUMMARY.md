## Phase 8: Security Highlights

### 1. Encryption System ✅ (303 lines)
**File**: `src/lib/encryption.ts`

**Features**:
- AES-256-GCM encryption (industry standard)
- PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- Browser-native Web Crypto API
- Secure API key storage
- Data masking for display
- Format validation

**Usage**:
```typescript
// Encrypt API key
await apiKeyManager.storeApiKey(apiKey, userId, 'openai');

// Retrieve API key (automatically decrypted)
const key = await apiKeyManager.getApiKey(userId, 'openai');

// Display masked version
const masked = apiKeyManager.getMaskedApiKey('openai');
// Result: "sk-***...***xyz"
```

**Security Features**:
- ✅ Client-side encryption (keys never sent in plaintext)
- ✅ User-specific master passwords
- ✅ Secure random IV and salt per encryption
- ✅ Tamper-evident (decryption fails if modified)

### 2. Audit Logging System ✅ (403 lines)
**File**: `src/lib/auditLogger.ts`

**Capabilities**:
- 20+ event types tracked
- 4 severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Batch processing (optimized performance)
- Automatic metadata enrichment (IP, user agent)
- Query and reporting functions
- Immutable audit trail

**Tracked Events**:
- User authentication (login, logout, failures)
- Payment operations (create, update, delete, approve)
- Contract operations (create, update, delete, approve)
- Legal AI operations (consultations, documents, cases)
- Sensitive operations (settings, exports, backups)
- Security events (RLS violations, unauthorized access)

**Usage**:
```typescript
// Log payment creation
await auditLogger.logPayment(
  'created',
  paymentId,
  companyId,
  { amount: 1500, method: 'bank_transfer' },
  true
);

// Log security event
await auditLogger.logSecurityEvent(
  'unauthorized_access_attempt',
  { resource: 'admin_panel', ip: '192.168.1.1' }
);

// Get audit summary
const summary = await auditLogger.getAuditSummary(companyId, 30);
```

### 3. Audit Logs Database ✅ (194 lines SQL)
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250901120000_create_audit_logs_table.sql`

**Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  severity VARCHAR(20) CHECK (severity IN ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical')),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id),
  entity_type VARCHAR(100),
  entity_id UUID,
  action VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  details JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  success BOOLEAN,
  error_message TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Features**:
- ✅ 7 performance indexes
- ✅ RLS policies (company-scoped viewing)
- ✅ Immutable records (no updates/deletes)
- ✅ Auto-capture IP address trigger
- ✅ Query and summary functions

**Functions**:
1. `get_audit_logs()` - Retrieve logs with filters
2. `get_audit_summary()` - Aggregated statistics
