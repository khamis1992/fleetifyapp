## 🚨 Deletion Process - Step by Step

### Step 1: Warning Dialog

When clicked, a comprehensive warning dialog appears showing:

#### Company Information
- Company name (if browsing another company)
- Total customers count
- Individual customers count  
- Corporate customers count
- Related contracts count
- Related invoices count

#### Warning Messages
1. **Main Warning:**
   - All customers will be permanently deleted
   - All related contracts will be deleted
   - All related invoices and payment schedules
   - All related payments and reports
   - Process may take several minutes
   - Ensure backup exists

2. **Additional Warning (if contracts exist):**
   - Shows count of contracts that will be deleted

#### Confirmation Requirement
User must type **exactly**: `حذف جميع العملاء`

### Step 2: Processing

Once confirmed, the system:

1. **Fetches all customers** for the company
2. **Processes in batches** (3 customers at a time)
3. **Shows real-time progress:**
   - Current step description
   - Progress bar (percentage)
   - Deleted count (green)
   - Processed count (blue)
   - Failed count (red)
   - Error messages (if any)

### Step 3: Deletion Sequence (Per Customer)

For EACH customer, the following is deleted in order:

```typescript
1. Payments related to invoices
2. Invoice items
3. Invoices
4. Vehicle condition reports (ALL, including contract-related)
5. Contract documents
6. Contract payment schedules
7. Contract approval steps
8. Quotations
9. Contracts
10. Customer notes
11. Finally, the customer record
```

### Step 4: Completion

Shows final results:
- Total processed
- Successfully deleted count
- Failed count
- Detailed error list (if any)

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Progress State Interface

```typescript
interface BulkDeleteProgress {
  total: number;           // Total customers to delete
  processed: number;       // Customers processed so far
  deleted: number;        // Successfully deleted
  failed: number;         // Failed deletions
  currentStep: string;    // Current operation description
  errors: Array<{         // Error details
    customerId: string;
    error: string;
  }>;
}
```

### Real-time Updates

The dialog updates in real-time showing:
- ✅ Progress bar animation
- ✅ Live counts (deleted/processed/failed)
- ✅ Current step description
- ✅ Error messages as they occur

)}
```

## 🔄 Database Operations

### Related Tables Affected

When deleting customers, these tables are affected:

```sql
1. payments (via invoice_id)
2. invoice_items (via invoice_id)
3. invoices (via customer_id)
4. vehicle_condition_reports (via contract_id)
5. contract_documents (via contract_id)
6. contract_payment_schedules (via contract_id)
7. contract_approval_steps (via contract_id)
8. quotations (via customer_id)
9. contracts (via customer_id)
10. customer_notes (via customer_id)
11. customers (primary table)
```

### Batch Processing

- **Batch Size:** 3 customers at a time
- **Delay Between Batches:** 200ms
- **Reason:** Avoid overwhelming the database

### Performance

For 422 customers:
- **Expected Time:** 3-5 minutes (depending on related data)
- **Batches:** ~141 batches (422 ÷ 3)
- **Total Delay:** ~28 seconds (141 × 200ms)

   ```

4. **Database Constraint Errors**

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] Test with super_admin role
- [ ] Test with company_admin role
- [ ] Test with regular user (should not see button)
- [ ] Test with empty company (button hidden)
- [ ] Test confirmation text validation
- [ ] Test progress tracking
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test with customers having many contracts
- [ ] Test with customers having many invoices
- [ ] Test dialog close prevention during processing
- [ ] Test cache invalidation after deletion

### Current Status for Company `24bc0b21-4e2d-4413-9842-31719a3669f4`

- ✅ **Total Customers:** 422
- ✅ **Button Visible:** Yes (if user has permissions)
- ✅ **Expected Deletions:** 422 customers + all related data
- ✅ **Estimated Time:** 3-5 minutes

---

## 🎯 Cache Invalidation

After successful deletion, these queries are invalidated:

```typescript
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['customers'] });
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['customer-statistics'] });
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['contracts'] });
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['invoices'] });
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['quotations'] });
```

**Effect:** All customer-related data refreshes automatically

---

## 🔒 Safety Features

### 1. Confirmation Text
- Must type exactly: "حذف جميع العملاء"
- Case-sensitive and space-sensitive
- Button disabled until correct

### 2. Information Display
- Shows exact counts before deletion
- Shows related data that will be deleted
- Multiple warning messages

### 3. Role-Based Access
- Only super_admin and company_admin
- Validated on both frontend and backend

### 4. Processing Prevention
- Cannot close dialog during processing
- Button shows "جاري الحذف..." when processing
- Progress cannot be cancelled once started

### 5. Error Recovery
- Each customer deletion is independent
- Errors don't stop the entire process
- Full error tracking and reporting

---

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile View Differences

1. **Button Size:** `size="sm"` instead of `size="lg"`
2. **Button Text:** "حذف الكل" (shorter) instead of "حذف جميع العملاء"
3. **Dialog Layout:** RTL (right-to-left) preserved
4. **Progress Display:** Responsive grid layout

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

```typescript
// In Customers page component
const [showBulkDeleteDialog, setShowBulkDeleteDialog] = useState(false);

// Handle button click
const handleBulkDelete = () => {
  setShowBulkDeleteDialog(true);
};

// Render dialog
<BulkDeleteCustomersDialog
  open={showBulkDeleteDialog}
  onOpenChange={(open) => {
    setShowBulkDeleteDialog(open);
    if (!open) {
      // Refresh data after dialog closes
      refetch();
    }
  }}
/>
```

---
