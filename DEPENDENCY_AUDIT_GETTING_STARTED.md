## 🎯 First Steps (Required)

### Prerequisites Check

Do you have npm installed?

```bash
npm --version
```

✅ **If yes** → Continue to Step 1  
❌ **If no** → Install Node.js first:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install node
```

**Windows:**
Download from https://nodejs.org/

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Initial Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /data/workspace/fleetifyapp

# Run setup script
./scripts/dependency-audit/setup-dependencies.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Installs npm-check-updates
- Creates package-lock.json
- Sets up directory structure
- Verifies environment

**Expected output:**
```
✓ npm-check-updates installed
✓ package-lock.json created
✓ Reports directory created
✓ Backup directory created
✓ Setup completed successfully!
```

### Step 2: Generate Initial Reports (1 minute)

```bash
./scripts/dependency-audit/generate-reports.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Scans all 84 dependencies
- Checks for security issues
- Identifies outdated packages
- Creates comprehensive reports

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Version currency report generated
✓ Security audit report generated
✓ Dependency tree report generated
✓ Report Generation Complete!
```

### Step 3: Review Your Status (2 minutes)

```bash
# View summary
cat scripts/dependency-audit/reports/summary-latest.md

# Check security
cat scripts/dependency-audit/reports/security-audit-latest.txt

# See outdated packages
cat scripts/dependency-audit/reports/version-currency-latest.txt
```

---

## 🎓 Your First Tasks

### Task 1: Address Security Issues (if any)

If the security report shows vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Try automatic fix
npm audit fix

# If needed, force fix (careful!)
npm audit fix --force

# Validate the fix
./scripts/dependency-audit/validate.sh
```

### Task 2: Update Safe Packages

```bash
# Update patch versions (safest)
./scripts/dependency-audit/update-dependencies.sh safe

# Validate
./scripts/dependency-audit/validate.sh
```

### Task 3: Set Up Daily Monitoring

**Option A: Cron Job (Linux/Mac)**

```bash
# Open crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs at 9 AM daily)
0 9 * * * cd /data/workspace/fleetifyapp && ./scripts/dependency-audit/monitor-dependencies.sh
```

**Option B: Manual Daily**

```bash
# Run each morning
./scripts/dependency-audit/monitor-dependencies.sh
```

---

## 📖 Essential Commands

### Daily Use

```bash
# Quick security check
npm audit

# Check for updates
ncu

# Run monitoring
./scripts/dependency-audit/monitor-dependencies.sh
```

### Monthly Maintenance

```bash
# 1. Generate reports
./scripts/dependency-audit/generate-reports.sh

# 2. Update dependencies
./scripts/dependency-audit/update-dependencies.sh minor

# 3. Validate
./scripts/dependency-audit/validate.sh

# 4. Test your app
npm run dev
```

### Emergency Procedures

```bash
# If something breaks after update
./scripts/dependency-audit/rollback.sh

# It will show available backups
# Then rollback to specific one:
./scripts/dependency-audit/rollback.sh 20251012_143022
```
