# Fleetify APK Build Output

This directory contains the generated APK file after running the mobile build process.

## How to generate the APK:

1. **Quick build**: `npm run build:apk`
2. **Verify build**: `npm run verify:apk`

## Expected output:
- `app-release.apk` - The final APK file ready for installation

## Note:
This directory is created automatically during the build process. The actual APK file will be generated when you run the build commands.
