# Fix for Contract Details Not Showing Properly

## Issue
When viewing contract details (e.g., contract number LTO202442), the contract information was not displaying correctly because:
1. Vehicle data was not being properly fetched in the ContractDetailsDialog
2. The contract object passed to the dialog might not contain all the enriched data

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced ContractDetailsDialog Component
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging contract data flow
- Improved vehicle data fetching with better error handling
- Updated the vehicle information section to display data from both:
  - The separately fetched vehicle data (via React Query)
  - The vehicle data that might already be attached to the contract object
- Added conditional rendering for vehicle information to handle cases where no vehicle data exists

### 2. Improved useContractsData Hook
- Added detailed logging to track the contract fetching process
- Enhanced vehicle data attachment process with better error handling
- Added console logs to monitor the number of vehicles being fetched

### 3. Better Data Handling
The fix ensures that contract details are displayed correctly by:
1. First checking if vehicle data is already attached to the contract object
2. If not, fetching vehicle data separately using the vehicle_id
3. Displaying vehicle information when available from either source

## Key Changes

### ContractDetailsDialog.tsx
- Added debug logging to track contract data flow
- Enhanced vehicle data fetching with better error handling
- Updated vehicle information section to show data from multiple sources
- Added conditional rendering for vehicle information

### useContractsData.tsx
- Added detailed logging for contract and vehicle fetching
- Improved error handling for vehicle data attachment
- Enhanced debugging information

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to the contracts list
2. Find a contract with vehicle data (e.g., contract number LTO202442)
3. Click "View" to open the contract details dialog
4. Confirm that all contract details are displayed correctly, including:
   - Contract number
   - Customer information
   - Vehicle information (if applicable)
   - Financial details
   - Contract terms and description

## Benefits
- Contract details now display correctly for all contracts
- Better error handling and debugging capabilities
- More robust data fetching for vehicle information
- Improved user experience when viewing contract details

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing the foreign key constraint between contracts and vehicles for better performance
- Add more comprehensive error handling for other related data (customers, accounts, etc.)
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
