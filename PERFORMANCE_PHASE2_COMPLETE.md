## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Breadcrumb Navigation

```typescript
// Smart collapsing for deep hierarchies
if (breadcrumbs.length > 4) {
  // Show first, collapse middle with dropdown, show last
  return (
    <>
      <FirstBreadcrumb />
      <DropdownMenu with MiddleBreadcrumbs />
      <CurrentPageBreadcrumb />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Route Preloading

```typescript
// Automatic preloading on app init
initializePWA();
preloadCriticalRoutes();

// Context-aware preloading
useEffect(() => {
  preloadRelatedRoutes(location.pathname);
}, [location.pathname]);
```

### PWA Service Worker

```javascript
// Network-first for API, cache-first for static
addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (isAPICall) {
    return networkFirstStrategy(event);
  }
  return cacheFirstStrategy(event);
});
```

### Offline Storage

```typescript
// Save with expiry
await saveToOfflineStorage(
  STORES.DASHBOARD,
  'summary',
  data,
  5 * 60 * 1000 // 5 minutes
);

// Load with expiry check
const data = await loadFromOfflineStorage(
  STORES.DASHBOARD,
  'summary'
);
```

## 🎓 Best Practices Established

### Navigation
```typescript
// ✅ Use enhanced Breadcrumbs component
import { Breadcrumbs } from '@/components/navigation/Breadcrumbs';

// In your page
<Breadcrumbs />
```

### Route Preloading
```typescript
// ✅ Use PreloadLink for navigation
import { PreloadLink } from '@/components/navigation/PreloadLink';

<PreloadLink to="/finance">Finance</PreloadLink>
```

### Offline Caching
```typescript
// ✅ Cache critical data with expiry
import { cacheDashboardData, getCachedDashboardData } from '@/utils/offlineStorage';

// On data fetch
const data = await fetchDashboard();
await cacheDashboardData(data);

// On offline
const cachedData = await getCachedDashboardData();
```

### PWA Installation
```typescript
// ✅ Use PWA utilities
import { showInstallPrompt, isAppInstalled } from '@/utils/pwaConfig';

if (!isAppInstalled()) {
  await showInstallPrompt();
}
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Service Worker Scope**
   - Service worker caches only same-origin resources
   - External APIs (Supabase) use network-first strategy

2. **Offline Limitations**
   - Cannot create new records offline (no background sync yet)
   - Only recently viewed data is cached
   - Expiry means stale data is discarded

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - IndexedDB not supported in very old browsers (fallback to localStorage)
   - Service Worker not supported in IE11 (graceful degradation)
   - PWA installation varies by browser/OS
