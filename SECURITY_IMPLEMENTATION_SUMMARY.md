## ⚠️ Remaining Security Configurations (User Action Required)

### 1. **Auth Configuration Settings**
The following settings need to be configured in your Supabase Dashboard:

#### **OTP Expiry Settings** (Dashboard → Auth → Settings)
- Current: OTP expiry exceeds recommended threshold
- **Action Required**: Set OTP expiry to 600 seconds (10 minutes) or less
- Location: Authentication → Settings → Security

#### **Leaked Password Protection** (Dashboard → Auth → Settings) 
- Current: Disabled
- **Action Required**: Enable leaked password protection
- Location: Authentication → Settings → Password Security
- Enable: "Prevent signup with leaked passwords"

### 2. **Database View Configuration**
One remaining security definer view needs manual review:
- **Action Required**: Check for any remaining views with SECURITY DEFINER property
- Run: `SELECT * FROM pg_views WHERE security_definer = true;` in SQL Editor
- Update any remaining views to use `security_invoker = true` instead
