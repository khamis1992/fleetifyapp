# 🔧 Complete Database Fix Guide for Financial Tracking

## ⚠️ Current Issues

You have **3 critical database issues** preventing the Financial Tracking system from working:

### 1. **Column Name Mismatches** ❌
- `monthly_payment` should be `monthly_amount`
- `payment_month` should be `payment_date`

### 2. **RLS Policy Blocking Inserts** ❌  
- Error: `"new row violates row-level security policy for table rental_payment_receipts"`
- Users cannot create rental payment receipts

### 3. **Customer Creation RLS Issues** ⚠️
- Customer ID returns null after insert due to RLS

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Fix Instructions

### **STEP 1: Fix RPC Functions (Column Names)**

1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy the entire contents of `fix-rpc-functions.sql`
5. Paste into the SQL Editor
6. Click **RUN** or press `Ctrl+Enter`
7. Wait for success message

**What this fixes:**
- ✅ Outstanding balance queries
- ✅ Unpaid months queries
- ✅ All financial tracking data display

---

### **STEP 2: Fix RLS Policies for Rental Receipts**

1. Still in **SQL Editor**, click **New Query**
2. Copy the entire contents of `fix-rental-receipts-rls.sql`
3. Paste into the SQL Editor
4. Click **RUN**
5. Wait for success message

**What this fixes:**
- ✅ Users can create rental payment receipts
- ✅ Users can view their company's receipts
- ✅ Users can update and delete receipts
- ✅ RLS error (42501) will be resolved

---

### **STEP 3: (Optional) Create Customer Function**

1. Click **New Query** in SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire contents of `create-customer-function.sql`
3. Paste and click **RUN**

**What this provides:**
- ⚡ Faster customer creation
- ✅ Atomic customer+contract creation
- ✅ Bypasses RLS limitations

**Note:** If you skip this, the system will use the manual fallback method (works but slower)

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: "Function already exists" error**
**Solution:** The SQL files use `CREATE OR REPLACE` or `DROP IF EXISTS`, so this shouldn't happen. If it does, it means the fix was already applied.

### **Issue: Still getting RLS error after running SQL**
**Solution:** 
1. Clear browser cache (`Ctrl+Shift+Delete`)
2. Hard refresh (`Ctrl+F5`)
3. Check if you're logged in with correct user
4. Verify the SQL ran successfully (check for error messages)

### **Issue: Column name error persists**
**Solution:**
1. Check that `fix-rpc-functions.sql` ran without errors
2. The functions need to be dropped first (which the SQL does)
3. If error about "cannot change return type", check that DROP commands ran

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Run SQL files in order** - dependencies matter
2. **Check console for errors** - browser console shows detailed errors
3. **Test with real data** - use existing customers first
4. **Keep SQL files** - you might need to re-run if you reset database
5. **Take note of success messages** - SQL outputs confirmation messages
