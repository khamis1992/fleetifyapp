## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Indexes not being used"
```sql
-- Update statistics
ANALYZE contracts;
ANALYZE payments;
ANALYZE customers;
```

### "RPC function not found"
```sql
-- Re-run migration
\i supabase/migrations/20251014000006_dashboard_stats_rpc.sql
```

### "Bundle size too large"
```bash
# Analyze what's in the bundle
npm run analyze

# Rebuild with optimization
npm run build
```

### "Tests failing"
1. Check that migrations are applied
2. Verify environment variables set
3. Ensure dev server is running
4. Review detailed error messages

**Full troubleshooting guide:** See `POST_OPTIMIZATION_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md`

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Run verification regularly** - Not just once, but after every major change
2. **Track metrics over time** - Export reports and compare trends
3. **Fix warnings early** - Yellow warnings often become red failures
4. **Test with production data** - Use realistic dataset sizes
5. **Monitor in production** - Set up automated performance tracking
