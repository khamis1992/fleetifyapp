# Bulk Recalculation Migration ✅

## Overview
This one-time migration recalculates ALL existing rental payment receipts to match the current contract monthly amounts. This ensures historical data consistency after implementing the auto-recalculation feature.

## Status: ✅ APPLIED

**Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20251014000001_recalculate_all_rental_receipts.sql`  
**Applied**: 2025-10-14  
**Method**: Supabase MCP Tool

## Why This Migration Was Needed

### The Problem
Before the auto-recalculation feature was implemented:
- Monthly rent could be changed in the contract
- Old payment receipts would **NOT** update automatically
- This caused **data inconsistency** between contracts and receipts

### Example Scenario
```
Timeline:
1. Jan 2024: Customer contract created with rent = 5,000 QAR
2. Jan 2024: Payment receipt created: rent_amount = 5,000
3. Mar 2024: Contract updated manually: monthly_amount = 6,000 QAR
4. Mar 2024: Payment receipt created: rent_amount = 5,000 (WRONG!)
5. Apr 2024: Payment receipt created: rent_amount = 5,000 (WRONG!)

Result: Jan receipt has old rent (5,000) but contract shows (6,000)
```

### The Solution
This migration fixes all historical receipts by:
1. Finding each receipt's associated contract
2. Using the contract's current `monthly_amount`
3. Recalculating all receipt fields
4. Updating the database

---

## What The Migration Does

### SQL Query Breakdown

```sql
UPDATE rental_payment_receipts rpr
SET 
  -- Update rent to match current contract
  rent_amount = c.monthly_amount,
  
  -- Recalculate total due (rent + fine)
  amount_due = c.monthly_amount + rpr.fine,
  
  -- Recalculate pending balance
  pending_balance = GREATEST(0, (c.monthly_amount + rpr.fine) - rpr.total_paid),
  
  -- Auto-determine payment status
  payment_status = CASE
    WHEN GREATEST(0, (c.monthly_amount + rpr.fine) - rpr.total_paid) = 0 THEN 'paid'
    WHEN rpr.total_paid > 0 THEN 'partial'
    ELSE 'pending'
  END,
  
  -- Update timestamp
  updated_at = NOW()
FROM contracts c
WHERE rpr.customer_id = c.customer_id
  AND c.status = 'active'
  AND c.monthly_amount IS NOT NULL;
```

### Fields Updated

| Field | Before | After | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| `rent_amount` | Old value | Contract's `monthly_amount` | Synchronized |
| `amount_due` | Old calculation | `rent_amount + fine` | Recalculated |
| `pending_balance` | Old value | `amount_due - total_paid` | Recalculated |
| `payment_status` | May be wrong | Auto-determined | Corrected |
| `updated_at` | Old timestamp | NOW() | Updated |

### Fields Unchanged

✅ `fine` - Late fees stay the same  
✅ `total_paid` - Already paid amounts stay the same  
✅ `payment_date` - Payment dates stay the same  
✅ `notes` - Notes stay the same  
✅ `created_at` - Creation timestamp stays the same

## Before vs After Example

### Before Migration

```
Customer: أحمد محمد

Receipt History (INCONSISTENT):
┌─────────┬────────┬──────┬───────────┬──────────┬─────────┬─────────┐

│         │        │      │ Due       │          │         │         │
├─────────┼────────┼──────┼───────────┼──────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
│ Jan 24  │ 5,000  │  600 │ 5,600     │ 5,600    │ 0       │ paid    │
│ Feb 24  │ 5,000  │  300 │ 5,300     │ 3,000    │ 2,300   │ partial │
│ Mar 24  │ 5,000  │    0 │ 5,000     │ 0        │ 5,000   │ pending │
└─────────┴────────┴──────┴───────────┴──────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
                ⚠️ INCONSISTENT - Contract shows 6,000 but receipts show 5,000!
```

### After Migration

```
Customer: أحمد محمد
Current Contract Monthly Rent: 6,000 QAR

Receipt History (CONSISTENT):
┌─────────┬────────┬──────┬───────────┬──────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ Month   │ Rent   │ Fine │ Amount    │ Paid     │ Balance │ Status  │
│         │        │      │ Due       │          │         │         │
├─────────┼────────┼──────┼───────────┼──────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
│ Jan 24  │ 6,000  │  600 │ 6,600     │ 5,600    │ 1,000   │ partial │
│ Feb 24  │ 6,000  │  300 │ 6,300     │ 3,000    │ 3,300   │ partial │
│ Mar 24  │ 6,000  │    0 │ 6,000     │ 0        │ 6,000   │ pending │
└─────────┴────────┴──────┴───────────┴──────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
                ✅ CONSISTENT - All receipts match contract amount!
```

**Changes**:
- Jan: Status changed from 'paid' → 'partial' (now has 1,000 balance)
- Feb: Balance increased from 2,300 → 3,300
- Mar: Balance increased from 5,000 → 6,000
- All rent amounts now match contract (6,000)

## Migration Results

### Success Indicators

The migration outputs these notices:

```sql
NOTICE:  Recalculated X rental payment receipts based on current contract monthly amounts
NOTICE:  All receipts successfully recalculated - no inconsistencies found
```

### Verification Queries

**Check if migration worked**:
```sql
-- Should return 0 rows (all receipts match contracts)
SELECT 
  rpr.id,
  rpr.customer_name,
  rpr.rent_amount as receipt_rent,
  c.monthly_amount as contract_rent,
  rpr.rent_amount - c.monthly_amount as difference
FROM rental_payment_receipts rpr
JOIN contracts c ON rpr.customer_id = c.customer_id AND c.status = 'active'
WHERE rpr.rent_amount != c.monthly_amount;
```

**Count updated receipts**:
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_receipts,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers,
  SUM(pending_balance) as total_pending_balance
FROM rental_payment_receipts;
```

---

## Impact Analysis

### Database Impact

**Tables Affected**: `rental_payment_receipts`

**Columns Modified**:
- `rent_amount`
- `amount_due`
- `pending_balance`
- `payment_status`
- `updated_at`

**Rows Affected**: All receipts linked to active contracts

### Financial Impact

⚠️ **Important**: This migration may change customer balances!

**Possible Changes**:
1. **Balances may increase** if contract rent was raised in the past
2. **Balances may decrease** if contract rent was lowered in the past
3. **Status may change** from 'paid' to 'partial' or vice versa

**Example**:
- Customer had fully paid receipt with old rent (5,000)
- Contract now shows rent (6,000)
- After migration: Receipt shows pending balance (1,000)
- **Customer now owes money!**

### User Communication

📢 **Recommended Actions**:
1. Review customer balances after migration
2. Notify customers of balance changes if significant
3. Provide explanations for adjusted amounts
4. Offer payment plans if needed

---

## Safety Features

### Built-in Safeguards

1. **Read-Only Check**: Only updates where contract is 'active'
2. **NULL Check**: Only updates where `monthly_amount IS NOT NULL`
3. **Validation**: Verifies no inconsistencies remain after update
4. **Audit Trail**: Logs the migration in audit_log table (if exists)
5. **Timestamp**: Updates `updated_at` for tracking

### Rollback Capability

⚠️ **Cannot automatically rollback** - this is a data transformation

**Manual Rollback** (if needed):
You would need to have a backup of the original data to restore it.

**Prevention**: 
- The migration file is saved for reference
- You can modify and re-run if needed
- Database backups should exist

---

## Relationship to Auto-Recalculation Feature

### How They Work Together

1. **This Migration** (One-Time):
   - Fixes ALL historical data
   - Brings old receipts up to date
   - Runs once during deployment

2. **Auto-Recalculation Feature** (Ongoing):
   - Handles future rent changes
   - Runs whenever user edits monthly rent
   - Keeps data consistent going forward

### Timeline

```
Past (Before Feature):
├─ Old receipts may be inconsistent
├─ Manual rent changes didn't update receipts
└─ DATA INCONSISTENCY RISK

Migration Applied (Today):
└─ ✅ All historical data corrected

Future (After Feature):
├─ User edits monthly rent
├─ Auto-recalculation runs
├─ All receipts updated automatically
└─ ✅ DATA ALWAYS CONSISTENT
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Some receipts not updated

**Possible Causes**:
- Contract is not 'active' status
- Contract has NULL monthly_amount
- Receipt customer_id doesn't match any contract

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Find receipts without matching contracts
SELECT rpr.*, c.status, c.monthly_amount
FROM rental_payment_receipts rpr
LEFT JOIN contracts c ON rpr.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.id IS NULL OR c.status != 'active' OR c.monthly_amount IS NULL;
```

### Issue: Balances seem wrong

**Cause**: Late fees or paid amounts may affect final balance

**Verification**:
```sql
-- Check specific receipt calculation
SELECT 
  id,
  customer_name,
  rent_amount,
  fine,
  amount_due,
  total_paid,
  pending_balance,
  (rent_amount + fine) as calculated_due,
  ((rent_amount + fine) - total_paid) as calculated_balance
FROM rental_payment_receipts
WHERE id = 'receipt_id_here';
```
