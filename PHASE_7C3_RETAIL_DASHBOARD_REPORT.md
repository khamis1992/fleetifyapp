## Forecasting Algorithm Details

### Method: Hybrid Approach
Our forecasting uses a combination of:

1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
   - Window: 7 days
   - Purpose: Smooth out daily fluctuations
   - Formula: `SMA = Σ(sales_i) / n`

2. **Linear Regression**
   - Method: Least Squares
   - Purpose: Detect overall trend
   - Formula: `y = mx + b` where
     - `m = (n·Σxy - Σx·Σy) / (n·Σx² - (Σx)²)`
     - `b = (Σy - m·Σx) / n`

3. **Day-of-Week Adjustment**
   - Purpose: Account for weekly patterns
   - Method: Calculate average sales per day of week
   - Adjustment: `forecast × (day_avg / overall_avg)`

4. **Confidence Interval (95%)**
   - Method: Standard deviation based
   - Formula: `forecast ± 1.96 × σ × √n`
   - Visual: Shaded area on chart

5. **Accuracy Measurement (MAPE)**
   - Formula: `MAPE = (1/n) × Σ|actual - forecast| / actual`
   - Displayed as percentage (0-100%)

### Data Requirements
- Minimum: 7 days of historical data
- Optimal: 60+ days for better accuracy
- Update frequency: Real-time as sales occur

## Known Limitations

1. **Stock Level Data**
   - Currently uses `min_stock_level` as proxy for current stock
   - Recommendation: Implement `inventory_stock_levels` table integration in future phase

2. **Vendor Lead Times**
   - Not currently factored into reorder calculations
   - Recommendation: Add `vendor_lead_time` field to vendor table

3. **Category Names**
   - Uses `item_type` (product/service) as simplified categories
   - Recommendation: Implement proper category taxonomy

4. **Forecast Limitations**
   - Requires minimum 7 days of data
   - Doesn't account for seasonality beyond day-of-week
   - Recommendation: Add seasonal decomposition in future

5. **Customer CLV**
   - Simple calculation (total_spent / customer_count)
   - Doesn't account for customer acquisition cost
   - Recommendation: Integrate marketing spend data

---

## Integration with Phase 7B

### Preserved Components
✅ `QuickStatsRow` - Kept in Row 1
✅ `SalesPipelineWidget` - Kept in Row 5
✅ `InventoryAlertsWidget` - Kept in Row 5
✅ `VendorPerformanceWidget` - Kept in Row 5

### Why Keep Phase 7B Widgets?
1. **Complementary Data** - Phase 7B widgets show different views
2. **User Familiarity** - Existing users may rely on them
3. **No Conflicts** - Widgets work independently
4. **Incremental Migration** - Can deprecate later if needed
