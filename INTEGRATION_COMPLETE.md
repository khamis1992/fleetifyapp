## Migration from localStorage

If you had previous data in localStorage:

```typescript
// Optional: Migrate old data
const oldReceipts = localStorage.getItem('carRentalReceipts');
if (oldReceipts) {
  // Use the migration script or contact support
  console.log('Old receipts found - migration available');
}
```

**Note:** The system now uses Supabase exclusively. localStorage is no longer used.

## Fine Calculation Rules

### Specification
- **Due Date:** Day 1 of every month
- **Fine Rate:** 120 QAR per day late
- **Maximum:** 3000 QAR per month
- **Calculation:** `min(days_late × 120, 3000)`

### Examples
| Payment Date | Days Late | Fine (QAR) |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Jan 1        | 0         | 0          |
| Jan 5        | 4         | 480        |
| Jan 10       | 9         | 1,080      |
| Jan 15       | 14        | 1,680      |
| Jan 20       | 19        | 2,280      |
| Jan 25       | 24        | 2,880      |
| Jan 31       | 30        | 3,000 (max)|

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "No customers found"
- **Solution:** Customer must have an active contract with `monthly_payment`

**Issue:** "Permission denied"
- **Solution:** Ensure user is logged in and has `company_id` in profile

**Issue:** "Fine not calculating"
- **Solution:** Verify payment date is in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

**Issue:** "Export not working"
- **Solution:** Check browser popup blocker settings

### Debug Mode
```typescript
// Enable React Query devtools
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools';

// Add to App.tsx
<ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
```
