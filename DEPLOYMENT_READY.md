## üöÄ Ready to Deploy!

Your Fleetify application is now configured for deployment on multiple platforms.

### ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented:

1. **Vercel Configuration** (`vercel.json`)
   - Static build setup
   - SPA routing configuration
   - Security headers
   - Environment variable mapping
   - Asset optimization

2. **Netlify Configuration** (`netlify.toml` + `_redirects`)
   - Build commands and publish directory
   - SPA routing support
   - Security headers
   - Static asset caching

3. **GitHub Actions CI/CD** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
   - Automated testing
   - Build process
   - Multi-platform deployment
   - Artifact management

4. **Enhanced Vite Config**
   - Explicit output directory
   - Optimized build settings
   - Better asset handling

## üîß Next Steps:

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VITE_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`
4. Deploy automatically or manually

### For Netlify Deployment:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
4. Deploy automatically

### For GitHub Actions:
Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`

## üîç Verification:

Test your deployment by:
1. Checking that the build completes successfully
2. Verifying SPA routing works (refresh on any route)
3. Confirming environment variables are loaded
4. Testing API endpoints (if any)
5. Validating static asset loading

## üö® Troubleshooting:

If you still get `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND`:
1. Ensure the correct repository is connected
2. Check build logs for errors
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Confirm the correct branch is being deployed

Your application should now deploy successfully! üéâ
