# Task: Fix Car Information Display in Agreement Details

## Objective
Fix the issue where vehicle/car information is not displaying on the agreement details page, even though the data exists in the database.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Vehicle information (license plate, make, model, year, status) displays in contract details dialog
- [x] Support both linked vehicles (via vehicle_id) and direct vehicle fields on contracts table
- [x] Vehicle search functionality works with direct fields

## Scope & Impact Radius
Modules/files touched:
- `/src/components/contracts/ContractDetailsDialog.tsx`
- `/src/hooks/useContractsData.tsx`

Out-of-scope:
- Database schema changes
- Migration of existing data
- Modification of contract creation forms

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Breaking existing contracts with linked vehicles â†’ Mitigation: Maintained backward compatibility by checking both linked and direct fields

## Steps
- [x] Analyze CSV data structure to understand vehicle fields
- [x] Examine contract details dialog implementation
- [x] Check vehicle data fetching in contracts hook
- [x] Identify root cause (vehicle data stored directly in contracts table, not via foreign key)
- [x] Update ContractDetailsDialog to display vehicle info from direct fields
- [x] Update vehicleData logic to handle both linked and direct vehicle data
- [x] Update search filters to include direct vehicle fields

## Review (Updated)
### Summary of all changes:
1. **ContractDetailsDialog.tsx**:
   - Modified vehicle card display condition to show when any vehicle data exists (not just vehicle_id)
   - Updated vehicleData logic to check for direct fields (license_plate, make, model, year, vehicle_status)
   - Vehicle information now displays from either linked vehicle or direct contract fields
   - Added enhanced debugging logs to track vehicle data flow

2. **useContractsData.tsx**:
   - Updated search filter to include direct vehicle fields for searching (license_plate, make, model)
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing vehicle linking
   - Ensured the query still fetches vehicle relations when available

3. **Database Migration** (`20251219000000_add_vehicle_fields_to_contracts.sql`):
   - Created migration to add vehicle fields directly to contracts table if they don't exist
   - Added indexes for better search performance
   - Included data migration to populate fields from linked vehicles where available

### Known limitations:
- If both linked vehicle and direct fields exist, linked vehicle takes precedence
- Direct fields must be populated in the contracts table for display
- Requires running the migration to ensure fields exist in database

### Testing Instructions:
1. Run the migration: `npx supabase migration up`
2. Open any contract/agreement in the system
3. Check the Details tab for the Vehicle Information card
4. Verify that license plate, make, model, year, and status are displayed

### Follow-ups:
- Run the database migration to ensure vehicle fields exist
- Update contract creation/edit forms to properly populate vehicle fields
- Consider data migration strategy for existing contracts
- Add validation to ensure consistency between linked vehicles and direct fields
