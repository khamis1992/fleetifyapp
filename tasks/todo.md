**Estimated Impact:** High - affects core business modules
**Risk Level:** Medium - requires careful database migrations and backwards compatibility

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Complete all missing database tables and migrations**
2. **Replace all mock/placeholder data with live Supabase operations**
3. **Implement all incomplete UI features (delete, toggle, export functions)**
4. **Improve data consistency across all modules**
5. **Ensure type safety and performance optimization**
6. **Achieve 100% functional implementation (zero TODOs remaining)**

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 235 files with TODOs reviewed and fixed
- [ ] Zero remaining TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments in codebase
- [ ] All CRUD operations persist to Supabase correctly

- `fleet_vehicle_insurance` (✅ already created)
- `fleet_vehicle_groups` (✅ already created)

**Hooks & Services:**
- 83 hook files with TODOs

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Database migrations fail in production | High | Low | Test all migrations on staging first; include rollback scripts |
| Breaking changes to existing features | High | Medium | Implement behind feature flags; comprehensive testing |
| Performance degradation with new queries | Medium | Medium | Add proper indexes; use query optimization |
| Type safety issues from removing 'any' types | Medium | Low | Incremental TypeScript strict mode adoption |
| Data loss from delete operations | Critical | Low | Implement soft deletes first; add confirmation dialogs |

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- All changes behind feature flags where applicable
- Comprehensive testing before merge
- Database migrations with reversible down scripts
- Incremental rollout per module
- Detailed commit messages for easy rollback
