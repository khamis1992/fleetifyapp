- Native mobile plugins (unless critical for functionality)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Breaking existing web functionality | High | Medium | Test web build after each mobile change; use feature flags for risky changes |
| APK signing/keystore configuration issues | Medium | Medium | Document keystore setup process; provide test keystore for development builds |
| Performance degradation on older devices | Medium | High | Set performance budgets; test on low-end Android devices (2GB RAM); implement aggressive code splitting |
| Platform-specific bugs (Android vs iOS) | Medium | High | Test on both platforms; use Capacitor's compatibility layer; maintain platform-specific code paths where necessary |
| Large bundle size for mobile networks | High | High | Implement aggressive code splitting; lazy load non-critical features; compress assets; aim for <3MB initial bundle |
| Offline sync conflicts when reconnecting | Medium | Medium | Implement conflict resolution strategy; use timestamp-based merge; clear error messages for users |
| Touch gesture conflicts with web interactions | Low | Low | Test all touch interactions; use standard mobile patterns (tap, swipe, pinch); prevent accidental triggers |
| Build failures due to missing dependencies | Medium | Low | Document all dependencies; provide setup checklist; use npm ci for consistent installs |
| Capacitor version compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Test with current Capacitor 6.2.1; document upgrade path if needed; check plugin compatibility |

## Notes & Best Practices

### Development
- Keep web app functionality intact - test after each change
- Use feature flags for risky mobile-specific changes
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Test on real devices, not just emulators
- Consider low-end Android devices (2GB RAM) for performance testing
- Document all workarounds for platform-specific issues

### Testing
- Test on multiple Android versions (API 29+)
- Test on different screen sizes (320px-428px width)
- Test on slow networks (3G, 4G)
- Test offline scenarios
- Test with screen readers (accessibility)

### Performance
- Aim for <3MB initial bundle
- Lazy load non-critical features
- Use code splitting aggressively
- Compress images (WebP format)
- Cache static assets aggressively
- Minimize API calls (batch requests)

### Security
- Never commit keystore files to Git
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement certificate pinning for production
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
