## üìä Parallel Execution Strategy

### Agent Independence
Each agent works on a separate business dashboard with no code conflicts:

| Aspect | Agent 1 (Car Rental) | Agent 2 (Real Estate) | Agent 3 (Retail) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Primary File** | CarRentalDashboard.tsx | RealEstateDashboard.tsx | RetailDashboard.tsx |
| **Components** | `src/components/dashboard/car-rental/*` | `src/components/dashboard/real-estate/*` | `src/components/dashboard/retail/*` |
| **Data Source** | Fleet, Vehicles, Contracts | Properties, Property Contracts | Sales, Inventory |
| **Dependencies** | Phase 7B modules | Phase 7B modules | Phase 7B modules |
| **Conflicts** | None (separate files) | None (separate files) | None (separate files) |

### Coordination Points
1. **Component Naming** - Use prefixed directories (car-rental/, real-estate/, retail/)
2. **Shared Hooks** - Use existing Phase 7B hooks (no modifications)
3. **Build Verification** - Each agent runs build after completion
4. **No Database Changes** - Use existing tables only

### Execution Timeline

**Day 1:**
- Hour 1: Launch all 3 agents simultaneously
- Hours 2-5: Agents work independently
- Hour 6: First checkpoint - verify progress
- Hours 7-8: Continue development

**Day 2:**
- Hours 1-4: Complete remaining widgets
- Hour 5: Individual testing
- Hour 6: Merge all changes
- Hour 7: Integration testing
- Hour 8: Documentation and final build
