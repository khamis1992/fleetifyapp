## 🔄 Integration Patterns Established

### Database Views Used
All agents leveraged existing integration views from `20251019230000_create_integration_views.sql`:
1. `inventory_purchase_order_summary` - Items with pending POs
2. `sales_inventory_availability` - Stock availability for sales
3. `vendor_purchase_performance` - Vendor ratings and delivery
4. `sales_order_fulfillment_status` - Order tracking across modules
5. `inventory_movement_summary` - Stock movement analytics
6. `inventory_reorder_recommendations` - Reorder suggestions

### Cross-Module Workflows
1. **Inventory → Purchase Orders:**
   - Low stock items trigger PO recommendations
   - Pending PO tracking on item details
   - Expected delivery timeline

2. **Sales → Inventory:**
   - Quote creation checks stock availability
   - Reserved inventory for pending orders
   - Backorder status tracking

3. **Vendors → Performance:**
