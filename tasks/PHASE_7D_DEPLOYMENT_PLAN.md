## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Database migration failure** | Critical | Low | Test all migrations on staging first; have rollback scripts ready |
| **Production downtime** | High | Low | Deploy during low-traffic hours; use blue-green deployment if possible |
| **Missing environment variables** | High | Medium | Verify all .env variables before deployment; use checklist |
| **Performance degradation** | Medium | Low | Load testing on staging; monitor metrics closely post-deployment |
| **Widget rendering errors** | Medium | Low | Test all dashboards pre-deployment; have feature flags ready |
| **User data loss** | Critical | Very Low | Full database backup before deployment; verify backup restoration |
| **Integration view failures** | Medium | Low | Test all integration queries on staging; monitor error logs |

**Rollback Strategy:**
1. **Level 1 (Code):** Git revert to previous commit
2. **Level 2 (Database):** Run migration down scripts
3. **Level 3 (Full):** Restore from backup (last resort)
