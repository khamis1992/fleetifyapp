# Invoices Page Fix - /finance/invoices

## Problem Identified
The `/finance/invoices` page couldn't be opened due to a hook import issue.

## Root Cause
The Invoices page was importing `useInvoices` from `@/hooks/useFinance`, which is an older implementation that doesn't properly handle company-based data filtering. There are two versions of the `useInvoices` hook in the codebase:

1. **Old version** (`@/hooks/useFinance.ts`):
   - Doesn't use `useUnifiedCompanyAccess`
   - Basic filtering without company_id
   - Missing pagination support
   
2. **New version** (`@/hooks/finance/useInvoices.ts`):
   - Uses `useUnifiedCompanyAccess` for proper company filtering
   - Supports pagination
   - Better error handling
   - Proper data structure with metadata

## Solution Applied

### File Modified
- **c:\Users\khamis\Desktop\fleetifyapp-3\src\pages\finance\Invoices.tsx**

### Change Made
```typescript
// Before:
import { useInvoices, useFixedAssets } from "@/hooks/useFinance"

// After:
import { useInvoices } from "@/hooks/finance/useInvoices"
import { useFixedAssets } from "@/hooks/useFinance"
```

## Benefits of This Fix

1. ✅ **Proper Company Isolation**: Uses `companyId` from `useUnifiedCompanyAccess` to ensure users only see invoices from their company
2. ✅ **Pagination Support**: The new hook supports pagination for better performance with large datasets
3. ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling and loading states
4. ✅ **Consistent Data Structure**: Returns data in a consistent format across all finance hooks
5. ✅ **Future-Proof**: Aligns with the new finance hooks architecture

## Verification

✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
✅ Build process: Successful
✅ Dev server: Started successfully
✅ Hot reload: Working properly

## Testing Recommendations

1. Navigate to `/finance/invoices` 
2. Verify invoices are loading correctly
3. Test filtering by status, type, and cost center
4. Verify search functionality
5. Test invoice creation, editing, and deletion
6. Verify invoice preview dialog opens correctly

## Note for Future Development

Consider deprecating the old `useInvoices` hook in `useFinance.ts` to prevent similar issues. All finance-related hooks should be imported from their dedicated files in `@/hooks/finance/` directory for better organization and maintainability.
