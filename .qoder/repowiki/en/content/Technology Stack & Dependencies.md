## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the technology stack used in FleetifyApp, a modern web application designed for fleet and contract management. The application leverages a carefully selected set of technologies to ensure type safety, efficient development workflows, responsive user interfaces, and robust backend integration. This documentation details the implementation and configuration of each core technology, their interrelationships, and practical usage patterns within the application.

## Core Technology Stack

### React for UI Components
React serves as the foundation for the user interface in FleetifyApp, enabling the creation of reusable, component-based UI elements. The application extensively uses React's component model to build a modular and maintainable interface, with components organized in the `src/components` directory. React's declarative approach allows developers to create complex UIs from simple building blocks, with state management handled through React hooks and context APIs.
