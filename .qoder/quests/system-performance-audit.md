# System Performance Audit Design

## Overview

This design document outlines a comprehensive performance audit strategy for the Fleetify application system, identifying performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities across frontend, backend, and database layers. The audit reveals that while significant performance improvements have been implemented, there are still areas requiring optimization to address the slow loading issues reported by users.
