# Fix Summary: "Yt.info is not a function" Error

## Problem Description
The production build was throwing the error "Yt.info is not a function" when the application tried to call `logger.info()` methods. This was happening because:

1. The Vite build configuration was aggressively removing console methods in production
2. The minifier was removing `console.info` calls but not properly handling the logger wrapper
3. The logger implementation wasn't resilient to minification

## Root Cause Analysis
In `vite.config.ts`, the terser options were configured to:
```javascript
compress: {
  drop_console: mode === 'production', // Remove console.logs in production
  pure_funcs: mode === 'production' ? ['console.log', 'console.debug', 'console.info'] : [],
}
```

This was causing the minifier to remove console methods, but the logger wrapper wasn't properly handling the missing methods.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Logger Implementation (`src/lib/logger.ts`)
- Created a safe console wrapper using `bind()` to preserve method references
- Added fallbacks for cases where console methods might be removed
- Used `console.info.bind(console)` instead of direct references

### 2. Modified Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- Disabled aggressive console method removal:
  ```javascript
  compress: {
    drop_console: false, // Keep console methods for our logger
    drop_debugger: true,
    pure_funcs: [], // Don't remove any console methods
  }
  ```

### 3. Made Logger More Resilient
- Added proper binding to console methods to prevent minification issues
- Ensured all logger methods have proper fallbacks
- Maintained the existing log level functionality

## Verification
- Successfully built the application without errors
- Verified that all logger methods work correctly
- Confirmed that the production build no longer throws the "Yt.info is not a function" error

## Files Modified
1. `src/lib/logger.ts` - Enhanced logger implementation
2. `vite.config.ts` - Updated build configuration
3. `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation file

## Testing
The fix has been tested by:
1. Running a production build to ensure it completes successfully
2. Verifying that the logger methods are properly preserved in the build
3. Starting the development server to confirm functionality

This fix ensures that the logger works correctly in both development and production environments without being affected by minification.
